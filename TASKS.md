# Task Tracker & Kanban

This file maintains the persistent planning board for the React GTM Kit project. Update task status and notes in-place as work progresses; never delete a task. Append new tasks instead of replacing existing entries so the project history remains auditable.

**Status definitions**
- **Backlog** – Planned work that has not yet started.
- **In Progress** – Actively being delivered.
- **Review** – Awaiting peer review, testing, or verification.
- **Blocked** – Requires external input or prerequisite completion.
- **Done** – Finished and documented.
