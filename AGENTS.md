# Agent Instructions

- Use [`TASKS.md`](./TASKS.md) as the single source of truth for planning and status tracking.
- Whenever you make repository changes, update the corresponding task statuses and notes in `TASKS.md` without deleting any existing tasks.
- Append new tasks instead of modifying IDs so the history remains auditable.
- Keep the note in the README pointing to `TASKS.md` intact unless you are explicitly instructed to change the tracking location.
