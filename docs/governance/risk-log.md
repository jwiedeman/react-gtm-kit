# Risk Log

This log tracks open privacy, security, and compliance risks along with mitigation status. Update entries when new information emerges or when actions close the gap.

| ID    | Category   | Description                                                                                    | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation / Next Steps                                                                                                                                                         | Owner           | Status    |
| ----- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | --------- |
| R-001 | Privacy    | Consent prompt deployment may slip for regional launches, delaying GTM enablement in EEA.      | High   | Medium     | Integrate CMP SDK by M1; add QA checklist covering consent states. Track implementation in product roadmap.                                                                     | Privacy Eng     | Open      |
| R-002 | Security   | Automated dependency updates not yet enabled, increasing time-to-remediate for new advisories. | Medium | Medium     | Dependabot monitors npm workspaces and GitHub Actions weekly via `.github/dependabot.yml`; triage expectations documented in `SECURITY.md`.                                     | Platform Eng    | Mitigated |
| R-003 | Compliance | Server-side tagging reference lacks documented DPIA considerations.                            | Medium | Low        | DPIA workflow and data flow documented in `docs/governance/dpia.md` and `docs/how-to/server-integration.md`; review lives in release checklist.                                 | Privacy Counsel | Mitigated |
| R-004 | Operations | No formal security disclosure channel published for external reporters.                        | Low    | Low        | Published `SECURITY.md` with security contact via GitHub Security Advisories, acknowledgement/triage SLAs, and coordinated disclosure guidance.                                 | OSS Maintainer  | Mitigated |
| R-005 | Privacy    | Consent evidence retention is inconsistent across apps, risking audit gaps.                    | Medium | Low        | Release checklist now requires archiving consent defaults and first updates with timestamps/regions per `docs/governance/dpia.md`; automation tracked in observability backlog. | Privacy Eng     | Mitigated |
| R-006 | Compliance | DPIA refresh for GTM containers not yet scheduled for the next milestone.                      | Medium | Medium     | Refresh cadence documented in `docs/governance/dpia.md` and owned in maintenance schedule; decisions logged in `docs/design/DECISIONS.md`.                                      | Privacy Counsel | Mitigated |
