# Risk Log

This log tracks open privacy, security, and compliance risks along with mitigation status. Update entries when new information emerges or when actions close the gap.

| ID    | Category   | Description                                                                                    | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation / Next Steps                                                                                                                         | Owner           | Status     |
| ----- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------- |
| R-001 | Privacy    | Consent prompt deployment may slip for regional launches, delaying GTM enablement in EEA.      | High   | Medium     | Integrate CMP SDK by M1; add QA checklist covering consent states. Track implementation in product roadmap.                                     | Privacy Eng     | Open       |
| R-002 | Security   | Automated dependency updates not yet enabled, increasing time-to-remediate for new advisories. | Medium | Medium     | Dependabot monitors npm workspaces and GitHub Actions weekly via `.github/dependabot.yml`; triage expectations documented in `SECURITY.md`.      | Platform Eng    | Mitigated  |
| R-003 | Compliance | Server-side tagging reference lacks documented DPIA considerations.                            | Medium | Low        | Document data flow and responsibilities in forthcoming `docs/how-to/server-integration.md`; review with legal before release.                    | Privacy Counsel | Planned    |
| R-004 | Operations | No formal security disclosure channel published for external reporters.                        | Low    | Low        | Published `SECURITY.md` with security@react-gtm-kit.dev contact, acknowledgement/triage SLAs, and coordinated disclosure guidance.               | OSS Maintainer  | Mitigated  |
| R-005 | Privacy    | Consent evidence retention is inconsistent across apps, risking audit gaps.                    | Medium | Low        | Add release sign-off checklist to ensure consent records (timestamp, version, region) are stored alongside deploys; automate archival in observability backlog. | Privacy Eng     | Open       |
| R-006 | Compliance | DPIA refresh for GTM containers not yet scheduled for the next milestone.                      | Medium | Medium     | Book privacy counsel review during M0, include noscript + consent changes, and record decision links in `docs/design/DECISIONS.md`.              | Privacy Counsel | Open       |

Use consistent IDs when updating rows so stakeholders can reference them in meetings and release checklists.
