# Launch Social Copy

Draft copy for the React GTM Kit 1.0 launch. Update tracked URLs (`{{url}}`) once the campaign links
are finalised. Metrics should be tracked via UTM parameters aligned with the KPI dashboard.

## Twitter / X Thread

1. 🚀 React teams deserve better than copy-pasted GTM snippets. Meet **React GTM Kit** – a production-
   ready toolkit with Consent Mode v2, SSR helpers, and multi-container support out of the box. {{url}}
2. ✅ Core library stays framework-agnostic: init once, queue events safely, and tear down cleanly for
   tests and microfrontends.
3. 🔁 Handling multiple containers? We guarantee deterministic load order and a single data layer.
4. 🛡️ Consent Mode v2 is built-in. Update ad_storage, analytics_storage, ad_user_data, and
   ad_personalization with a single call. Docs: {{url}}
5. 🧱 React adapters for modern + legacy stacks handle StrictMode remounts so you don't double-fire
   events.
6. 🌐 Next.js helpers bring App Router routing analytics, CSP nonce propagation, and SSR noscript
   helpers. Example app walks you through it.
7. 🧪 Smoke-tested examples + governance docs prove we sweat the details: coverage gates, size
   budgets, release automation.
8. 🔗 Ready to instrument confidently? Install `@jwiedeman/gtm-kit` and follow the task-based guides
