# Conference Abstract – React GTM Kit 1.0

**Title:** Shipping Consent-Aware Tag Management Across Every React Era

**Session Type:** 30-minute conference talk (or 20-minute meetup talk)

**Abstract:**

React applications straddle everything from legacy class components to bleeding-edge App Router
setups, yet most teams still copy and paste the same GTM snippet and hope for the best. The React GTM
Kit 1.0 release packages production-ready primitives—multi-container orchestration, Consent Mode v2,
SSR noscript helpers, and server-side tagging bridges—so instrumentation stops being a late-night
fire drill.

In this session we will:

1. Break down the core GTM contract (data layer + container) and why React complicates it.
2. Walk through how React GTM Kit guarantees deterministic script loading, queued events, and consent
   propagation across frameworks.
3. Demo live examples: React StrictMode SPA, Next.js App Router with CSP nonce, and a server relay.
4. Share governance playbooks that keep releases safe (size budgets, coverage gates, semantic-release).

Attendees leave with actionable recipes, runnable examples, and guidance on scaling GTM reliably in
React ecosystems. They can ship compliant analytics without reinventing the wheel for each project.

**Target audience:** Frontend leads, developer experience engineers, marketing technologists.

**Prerequisites:** Familiarity with React basics and Google Tag Manager concepts.

**Call-to-action:** Visit the docs site, clone the examples repo, and contribute feedback through
GitHub issues or community chat.

**Status:** Ready for CFP submission. Maintain deadlines, event notes, and reviewer feedback below.
